\addchap{List of Symbols}

This section is optional. 
Ask your supervisor whether it is required for your thesis. 
If you have more than 10 formulas involved it probably is.

There are two ways to build a list of symbols:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If you just want to get it done, then use a \texttt{longtable} and fill your symbols in, see table below.
    \item If you want it fancy, then package \texttt{glossaries} (maybe \texttt{glossaries-extra}) may be your way to go. 
    Be warned that although it automates symbol handling (e.g. sorting and referencing of symbols), it comes with some administrative overhead. 
    You can find a discussion on different ways to achieve this \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/366282}{on https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/366282}.
\end{itemize}

\(\psi\) & rad & Heading angle of hamster \\
\(\dot x\) & m/s & Linear velocity of hamster \\
\(\ddot x_0\) & m/s$^2$ & Initial acceleration of hamster \\
